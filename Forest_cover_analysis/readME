Step 1: Run “merge_country_level_RDS.R” to get the PA and control files merged at the country level. Resulting files are stored here: “/gpfs/data1/duncansongp/GEDI_global_PA/Country_level_RDS/”
Step 2: Run “processing_Ctrl_loss_mask_layer_cell_by_cell.R” and “processing_Ctrl_loss_mask_layer_cell_by_cell.R” parallelly, which in turn parallelly processes country-level merged PA and control files generated from the previous step respectively to get the area of forest cover loss at cell-level for each matched PA and control at country-level.
Step 3: Run “analyze_pa_and_ctrl_area_loss.R” to summarize the mean forest loss area and area loss difference per matched PA and control polygon.
Step 4: Run “get_country_biome_level_mean_area_loss.R” and “get_country_biome_level_area_loss_significance.R” to get summarized average area of forest cover loss and its associated statistical significance values at country-biome-level.
Step 5: Run “get_country_level_mean_area_loss.R” and “get_country_level_area_loss_significance.R” to get summarized average area of forest cover loss and its associated statistical significance values at country-level.
Step 6: Run “figure_chloropeth.R” to generate the choropleth map to visualize country-level area loss between PAs and controls.
